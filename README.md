# CleanFizzBuzz
A clean implementation of Fizz Buzz using reflection written in .Net 8 c#

## What is Fizz Buzz?

The Fizz Buzz challenge is a simple programming task often used in coding interviews and beginner exercises. The challenge is to write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three, the program should print "Fizz" instead of the number, for multiples of five, it should print "Buzz," and for multiples of both three and five, it should print "FizzBuzz." This exercise tests basic control flow and logic implementation skills.

## How to run the program
Compile and run your program using the following command:
```bash
dotnet run
```
This will compile the application and execute it, displaying the output in the terminal.
